# My dotfiles 💻

This repository contains all my dotfiles, managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).

## Installation 🪄

There's no need to install or configure anything upfront!

Just open your terminal and run:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthurgeek/dotfiles/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then take a moment to treat yourself to a refreshing cup of ☕️.

The following will happen:

1. Install `homebrew` and `chezmoi`

2. Once the installation completes, `chezmoi` will be initialized and dotfiles applied.

That's all! 🚀
