* MacOS automation + dotfiles

This repository contain scripts to automate MacOS installation of some default packages, some system settings and dotfiles.

There's no need to install or configure anything upfront! :)

The script is idempotent, so you can run many times you want.

Inspired by https://github.com/atomantic/dotfiles.

** Installation

After cloning, edit [[file:install.sh][install.sh]] to add a [[file:install.sh::#%20hostname="MyAwesomeHostname"][hostname]] and make some [[file:install.sh::#%20Configuration][configurations]].
Also edit [[file:Brewfile][Brewfile]] and specify which brew / cask packages you want to install.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
#+END_SRC

That's all :)
